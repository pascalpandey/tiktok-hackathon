**Problem Statement 3 – Social E-commerce**

## Identified Social Challenges:
As online shoppers, we would like to know what previous shoppers think or feel about a certain product before committing ourselves to making a purchase. This is a problem in most e-commerce applications today since there isn’t an explicit channel where we can share or watch people’s testimonies on their shopping experience.

In addition to that, most applications do not have a feature where users can share their wish list among close friends due to privacy issues. However, some users might find this beneficial as they can understand their friends’ shopping interests and may gift what they wish for on special occasions.

## Our solution:
We would like to introduce two new features to tackle such problems:
1.	**Testimonies**  
Testimonies is a section filled with short videos of user reviews with provided ratings and link to the shop. When looking into a product, users can view other users’ testimonies and reviews to understand their shopping experience better.   

    **Demonstration:**    
a.	Users enters the item they are searching for.  
b.	Users can either view all testimonies for different shops that sells such products,  
c.	Or view a certain product and watch all testimonies of that specific product.  

2.	**Shared Wish List**  
This feature allows users (out of their consent) to share their wish list among their close friends.

    **Demonstration:**  
a.	Users can check out the wish list section to view their wish list and other wish lists shared to them.  
b.	Users can also view their friends shared wish by clicking into their profile.
