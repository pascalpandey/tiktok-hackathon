# TikTok Hackathon
**Problem Statement 3 – Social E-commerce**

## Identified Social Challenges:
As online shoppers, we would like to know what previous shoppers think or feel about a certain product before committing ourselves to making a purchase. This is a problem in most e-commerce applications today since there isn’t an explicit channel where we can share or watch people’s testimonies on their shopping experience.

In addition to that, most applications do not have a feature where users can share their wish list among close friends due to privacy issues. However, some users might find this beneficial as they can understand their friends’ shopping interests and may gift what they wish for on special occasions.

## Inspiration
Short form videos are the trend in this current day and age since they are oddly engaging in a sense. That is why we chose to expand this experience towards the online shopping space. It nicely kills two birds with one stone, eliminate doubts in users while online shopping and also increasing user engagement.


## What it does
What we built was 2 main features on top of TikTok Shop. The first being an innovative way to improve product review methods, the second being a way to tackle the common gift-giving method. The first feature allows users to review products using TikTok videos, allowing other potential buyers to view their reviews in an engaging manner. The second feature allows users (out of their consent) to share their wish list among their close friends. It offers a sneak peek into friends' interests and wishes, making gift selection more thoughtful and personal.


Both features not only solves issues in their own respective domains, but also increases the chance of attracting new users to the platform.


## How we built it
- Chose a problem statement where everyone can contribute their utmost effort.
- Chose the technology everyone is comfortable with, coded in VScode and collaborated through GitHub.
- Blood, sweat, tears, and a few endless days of non-stop coding.
## Challenges we ran into
Main challenges we ran into were implementing how the search bar queries the users and products efficiently, implementing the follower-following mechanism, and roadbumps due to Next JS's poor development experience (always restarting after several minutes of development).
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Fast and functioning search bar
- query-as-you-scroll algorithm to ease on queries (to query only whats needed at a time).
## What we learned
- Team coordination is important to ensure software quality and timely delivery.
- Miscommunication will always happen, we just need to go through it as a team.


## What's next for TikTok Shop
- Give incentives (cashback, discount, voucher, etc.) for new users that are looking to buy an item on a friend's wishlist on the week of their birthday. This is to increase the chance of attracting new users on the platform only if TikTok allows.
- Create attractive games that make the users' friends to guess the top item on their wishlist and recieve incentives if they guess it right. (We did not implement this because we found an unsolvable loophole).
